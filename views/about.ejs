        <h1>Welcome to the Make Electronics Notebook</h1>
        <p>
          This website was designed to help readers of <em>Make: Electronics, Third Edition</em> 
          keep track of their experiments discussed throughout the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use the website, click on a section that corresponds with a section in the book. 
          Then click on an experiment to open a dedicated page where you can add content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each experiment page is broken down into three parts: 
          <strong>components</strong>, <strong>instructions</strong>, and <strong>observations</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you follow along with the book, you can include the components from the experiment, 
          add your own instructions based on the ones given in the book, 
          and finally use markdown to write your observations.
        </p>

        <h2>Markdown Support</h2>
        <p>
          Instructions and observations support basic markdown formatting to help you organize your notes. Here are a few examples:
